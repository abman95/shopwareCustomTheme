-   In a new tab, navigate to `localhost/admin`.

##### Feature 1: Enhanced Shopping Cart Button

-   On the `localhost` page, open a product. The "Add to shopping cart" button shows an animation effect for 1 second upon clicking, changing its background color and text to "Being added to shopping cart".
-   To modify this animation color, log into `localhost/admin` with Username `admin` and Password `shopware`.
-   Navigate to `Content/Themes`, select `AbmanTheme`, and adjust the "Cart Click Animation Color" under Color Settings.
-   Save and confirm changes. Refresh the product page (F5) to view the updated animation color.

##### Feature 2: Product FAQ Functionality (Local Storage)

-   On `localhost/admin`, go to `Catalogues/Products/Product FAQ`. Here, select a product to add FAQ questions and answers, which will be displayed on the product page.
-   On the product detail page under "Produkt FAQ:", users can submit questions. These questions are stored locally using LocalStorage and appear under "Unbeantworteten FAQ Fragen" in the `Catalogues/Products/Product FAQ` section. Answering these questions will display the responses on the respective product detail page.
-   Please note that the FAQs are currently stored only locally due to an incomplete controller and entity setup. The unfinished, non-functional controller and entity are located separately in the `AbmanTheme` folder for reference.
